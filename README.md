2. Please update the database creadentials on config/config file
3. I created a reusable function for executing query and table checking and creation 
4. In this code i have not done the validation on api inputs
5. added a automation test cases 

How to run -
1. clone from git
2. run yarn install on the respective project folder
3. also install nodemon on project and also need to install global on the system
4. run yarn start

If you want to create a table just need to create a json file in schemas with column name as a key and column settings properties as value

Things which is new in this assessment for me -
1. previously i have not done dynamic table creatation using json
2. and also i used first time automation test in node backend 

I write code with 30% knowledge and 70% from documentation and using internet.
